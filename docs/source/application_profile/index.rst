The Weather Information Statistical Post-processing System (WISPS) is a software infrastructure that supports Statistical Post-processing (StatPP) and is maintained as community code.
This infrastructure includes conventions and tools for data representation as well as software repositories that facilitate the use of these conventions.
The purpose of this document is to propose conventions for encoding binary data in WISPS.

  NetCDF (CF) is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data
  The conventions for climate and forecast (CF) metadata are designed to promote the processing and sharing of netCDF files
  The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data.
