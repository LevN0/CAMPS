The Weather Information Statistical Post-processing System (WISPS) intends to foster community involvement, experimentation, and improvement.
One of the most important tools we can develop to foster these goals is a well-designed, flexible, and supported standards for data exchange.
The documents below address this important need.

WISPS has drafted an application profile that proposes a standard-based approach to encoding data and metadata to support the post-processing of NWP output.
The concepts presented in the *Application Profile for Encoding Data in netCDF-CF to inter-operate with the Weather Information Statistical Post-processing System (WISPS)* are quite general.
This document applies to data flies as well as parameter files.
