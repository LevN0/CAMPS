The NWS Codes Registry:  Using linked data to support WISPS
===========================================================

**************************************
Introduction to the NWS Codes Registry
**************************************

The NWS Codes Registry (https://codes.nws.noaa.gov) supports a number of projects, including XML-encoding of aviation products and the Weather Information Statistical Post-processing System (WISPS).  Most of the techniques described here apply to all of them.  The technical documentation for the application that runs the codes registry can be found at https://github.com/UKGovLD/registry-core/wiki/Api.

Most of the techniques described here require a user to authenticate and be granted elevated privileges.  This process will not be described here.
