The Weather Information Statistical Post-processing System intends to foster community involvement, experimentation, and improvement.
One of the most important tools we can develop to foster these goals is a well-designed, flexible, and supported standards for data exchange.
The documents below address this important need.

WISPS has drafted an application profile that embodies a standard-based approach to encoding data and metadata to support the post-processing of NWP output.
The concepts presented in the *Application Profile for Encoding Data in netCDF-CF to inter-operate with the Weather Information Statistical Post-processing System (WISPS)* are quite general.
This document applies to data flies as well as parameter files.

Other documentation files are planned.
These include an similar (and smaller) application profile for encoding statistical post-processing parameters, and documents that are specific to encoding data and parameters to support MDL's Model Output Statistics (MOS) technique.
